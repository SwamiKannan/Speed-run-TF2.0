![cover image](cover.jpg)


It had been a long time since I worked on models using TensorFlow 2.0. I thought the best way to get back into TF was to do a speed run on the breast cancer dataset in sklearn.datasets. It is a tabular dataset. Next step - Detection of tumors through images

## Key stats:
### Time for: 

<b> EDA + preprocessing + modelling </b> 9.46 minutes <br>
<b> Till model training </b>10.15 minutes<br>
<b> Till model evaluation </b> 13.76 minutes<br>
