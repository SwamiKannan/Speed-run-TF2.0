# Speed-run-TF2.0
Just a speed run on a simple dataset

It had been a long time since I worked on models using TensorFlow 2.0 so I wanted to get back into it. I thought the best way to get into it was to do a speed run on the breast cancer dataset in sklearn.datasets

## Key stats:
### Time for: 

<b> EDA + preprocessing + modelling </b> 9.46 minutes
<b> Till model training </b>10.15 minutes
<b> Till model evaluation </b> 13.76 minutes
